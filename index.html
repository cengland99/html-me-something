      <h1>A Week In New York City</h1><br>

          <p>This spring I had the pleasure of spending spring break with my family visiting New York City!  We were there for 5 days and were exhausted by the end... It's hard to go to bed in the city that never sleeps.<br>

            Our trip happened to be over St. Patricks day weekend.  New York boasts one of the oldest and largest St. Patty's 
            day parades in the United States.  The parade runs up 5th Ave, and was only a a few blocks from our hotel.  It runs 
            for an incredible 5 hours.
